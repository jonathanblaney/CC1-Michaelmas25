Files and notebooks for Core Course 1.

Here you will find files for the lectures and workshops for Core Course 1. For space reasons, large files may need to be downloaded from other sources, but this repository should contain all the other files you need. General information about the course, and descriptions of individual sessions, will be found on Moodle.

## Running a notebook from Colab

To run a notebook, which will have the file termination `.ipynb`, you can import it from [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/):

```
File > Upload notebook > GitHub
```
Then enter the address of this repository. You will be given a list of notebooks in the repository to choose from. If you have Jupyter Notebook installed on your laptop, you can also download and run the notebooks, but please be aware that they were written for Colab so may need modification (most importantly, Colab is its own sandboxed environment, so we have not had to worry about Python [virtual environments](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html)).
